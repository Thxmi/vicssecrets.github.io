    <h2>The History of the Internet</h2>
    <p>The Internet has largely incorporated into daily life. The Internet has become an essential part of our 
        daily routines, from looking up dinner recipes to purchasing new bedroom accessories and viewing 
        our favourite shows. However, it wasn't always as polished as it is now. The history of the Internet is 
        a detailed and convoluted progression that produced the Internet as we know it today.

        <dt>1969: Arpanet</dt>
            <dd>
                <img src="images/Picture2.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                When packet switching technology first became available, Arpanet was the first actual 
              network to use it. Stanford University and UCLA connected their computers for the first time 
            on October 29, 1969. They were essentially the first hosts on the future Internet. Although 
            the link between the two colleges purportedly collapsed on the letter "g," the first message 
             transmitted over the network was intended to be "Login."

                Another significant event that occurred in the 1960s was the creation of Unix, an operating 
             system whose architecture had a significant impact on that of Linux and FreeBSD, the two 
               most common operating systems used today in web servers and web hosting services

            <dt>  1970: Arpanet Network</dt>
            <dd>
                In 1970, BBN (the business that produced the "interface message processor" computers 
                needed to connect to the network) formed an Arpanet network with Harvard, MIT, and 
                other institutions.

            <dt>  1971: Email</dt>
            <dd>
                Ray Tomlinson developed email in 1971. He also decided to use the "@" symbol to 
                differentiate the username from the machine name (which subsequently evolved into the 
                domain name).
            </dd>
            <dt>  1971: Project Gutenberg and eBook</dt>
            <dd>
                Starting Project Gutenberg was one of the year's most notable developments. For those who 
                are not aware with the website, Project Gutenberg is an international initiative to make 
                books and papers in the public domain available electronically for free in a range of eBook 
             and electronic formats. It all started when Michael Hart had access to a significant amount 
             of computing time and realized that the future of computers lay not in computation but 
             rather in the archiving, retrieval, and searching of knowledge that, at the time, was only 
             available in libraries. He began Project Gutenberg to make knowledge found in books 
              broadly accessible in electronic form, physically typing the "Declaration of Independence" 
             (OCR wasn't available at the time). The eBook was born as a result of this

            <dt>  1972: CYCLADES</dt>
            <dd>
                In 1972, CYCLADES, a project similar to Arpanet, was launched in France. Despite Cyclades' 
                eventual demise, it did give rise to a crucial concept: data transmission should be handled by 
                the host computer rather than the network itself
            </dd>
            <dt> 1973: The first trans-Atlantic connection and the popularity of emailing</dt>
            <dd>
                In 1973, Arpanet established its first transatlantic connection with the University College of 
                 London. Email constituted 75% of all Arpanet network activity during the same time period.
            </dd>
            <dt>  1974: The beginning of TCP/IP</dt>
            <dd>
             <img src="images/Picture4.jpg" alt=""> <br>
             The year 1974 saw significant progress. A plan to connect Arpa-like networks into an 
            ungoverned "inter-network" that revolved around a transmission control protocol (which 
             subsequently became TCP/IP) was released.
