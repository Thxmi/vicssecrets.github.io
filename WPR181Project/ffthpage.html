        <h2>Internet Protocols </h2>
        <p>Internet Protocols are a collection of guidelines that control how people communicate and exchange data online. 
            To transmit data, both the transmitter and the recipient must adhere to the same protocols. 
            Let's use a language as an example to help us better comprehend it. Any language has its own vocabulary and grammar,
             which we must understand in order to communicate. Similar to this, 
            whenever we use the internet to browse a website or send data to another device,
             such actions are subject to a set of guidelines known as internet protocols.
             </p>
             <h3><u>Types of Internet Protocols:</u></h3>
        <dl>
         <dt> TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol)</dt>
         <dd>These are a set of common guidelines that permit communication between various 
            computer kinds. Every machine that is linked to the Internet must have a unique serial 
            number, or IP address, according to the IP protocol. TCP defines how data is transmitted over 
            the internet and how IP packets should be formed from it. Additionally, it checks to see if the 
            message has been appropriately transmitted to the intended recipient and ensures that the 
            packets contain information about the message's source, destination, and recommended 
            order of re-assembly. Another name for the TCP is a connection-oriented protocol.</dd>
         <dt> SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</dt>
         <dd>These procedures are crucial for the transmission and distribution of outgoing emails. This 
            protocol reads the email header to determine the recipient's email address before adding 
            the message to the outgoing mail queue. Additionally, it removes the email from the 
            outgoing list as soon as it delivers the message to the recipient's email address. The text, 
            video, image, etc. may be included in the message or electronic mail. Setting up some 
            communication server rules is made easier by it.</dd>
         <dt> PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)</dt>
         <dd>The direct link between two communicating devices is made possible by this communication 
            protocol. This protocol specifies the guidelines by which two devices will communicate data 
            and carry out mutual authentication. As an illustration, a user might use PPP when 
            connecting his PC to an ISP's server. Similar to that, PPP is used to establish a direct 
            connection between two routers</dd>
         <dt> FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</dt>
         <dd>One machine to another can transmit files using this protocol. Client-server technology is 
            used here. When a machine requests a file transfer from another machine, the FTO 
            establishes a connection between the two and uses ID and Password to verify each other's 
            identities. And the devices really transfer the needed files.</dd>
         <dt> SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)</dt>
         <dd>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) over Secure Shell (SSH) is referred to as SFTP, also known as SSH 
            FTP, because both commands and data are encrypted during transmission. In order to 
            exchange files and data securely across a secure shell data stream, SFTP functions as an 
            extension of SSH. When running commands from the command line, this protocol is used to 
            connect remotely to other systems.</dd>
         <dt>Usenet</dt>
         <dd>Uses the NNTP protocol to provide main news service and public discussion forum.
             Articles posted make their way to large computers and distributed there using NNTP. Small computers may receive a small amount of the article or non.
             The NNTP is anonymous, which means it requires no identification and password from the client. </dd>
         <dt>Gopher</dt>
         <dd>This protocol is a publishing and information retrieval tool. Like hierarchical menus,
             it supports three types of items: menus, documents, and servers. The details on where their 
             items are stored is hidden to the user. Gopher emphasises on the simple design of the client programs, rather, 
             all important intelligence is added to servers. </dd>
         <dt>DEC VTX</dt>
         <dd>This a video system, which stores information in a tree structure. Each subject is collected in ‘stories’ or manypages.
             The page could either be a menu, a query form, or an information page. Pages may need an external application to be used,
              so a page can be distributed to multiple machines without the user’s knowledge.
            </dd>
