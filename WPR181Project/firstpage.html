    <p>A user should use their client machine to supply a universal identifier to the web server through their browser in order to access the required page. 
        The identifier could either be a URL, universal resource locator, or URI, uniform resource identifier. 
        The website receives the identifier and retrieves the page or media associated with the identifier and presents it to the client machine, the browser.
