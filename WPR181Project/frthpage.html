        <h2>Evolution of the Internet</h2>
        <p>
            As explained before the early predecessor of the internet was the ARPNET which relied on a central information system,
             which was the main thing that changed with the internet.
             With the idea of a decentralized information source the development of the internet began. 
            It was through the creation of TCP/IP that this goal was achieved, a decentralized web of information, 
            and the internet was born. Since that year, 1983, a lot of advancements have been made to the internet.

            <dt> 1975: The email client</dt>
            <dd>
                In 1975, John Vittal, a programmer at the University of Southern California, created the first 
                modern email program in response to the growing popularity of emailing. The addition of 
                "Reply" and "Forward" capability was the program's (named MSG's) largest technological 
                advancement.

                The Internet as we know it now made significant advancements in 1977. It was the year that 
                Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington unveiled and first sold to computer hobbyists the first 
                PC modem.

                MultiUser Dungeon, also known as MUD, was the forerunner to World of Warcraft and 
                Second Life when it was created in 1979. Role-playing games, interactive storytelling, and 
                online chat were all combined in the text-only virtual worlds known as MUDs
            </dd>
            <dt>   1979: Usenet</dt>
            <dd>
                Usenet, developed by two graduate students, entered the picture in 1979 as well. Usenet 
                was a discussion platform based on the internet that enabled users from all over the world 
                to communicate by publishing open messages that were grouped by newsgroups

            <dt>  1980: ENQUIRE software</dt>
            <dd>
                Tim Berners-Lee's hypertext tool ENQUIRE, developed by the European Organization for 
                Nuclear Research (CERN), was made available so that researchers at the particle physics 
                facility could keep track of individuals, programs, and projects using hypertext (hyperlinks).

            </dd>
            <dt>   1987: The Internet grows</dt>
            <dd>
                Nearly 30,000 hosts were active on the Internet in 1987. The TCP/IP standard makes it 
                possible to connect to more hosts than the 1,000 allowed by the original Arpanet protocol.

            <dt> 1989: The proposal for the World Wide Web</dt>
            <dd>n 1989, Tim Berners-Lee also proposed the idea for the World Wide Web. It was first 
                delivered in the March issue of MacWorld before being reissued in May 1990. It was created 
                to convince CERN that having a worldwide hypertext system would be in its best interests. 
                The term "World Wide Web" was first used in 1990, while Berners-Lee was writing the code 
                for what was initially known as "Mesh."</dd>
