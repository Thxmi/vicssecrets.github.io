        <h2>Client-side and server-side engineering</h2>
        <p>The software running in a browser is client-side code and its main purpose is to optimize a made web pages appearance and behaviour.
             Server-side website programming entails selecting which material in response to request is returned to the browser.
             Examples of sever-side task would include managing validating submitted data and queries, and submitting the right data as required to the client. </p>

        <h3> <a><u>Sever-side engineering</u></h3>
        <p>Web severs are used to perform ser-side scripting; they build interactive websites. The net sever has a filling system which will access it. A web sever could be a server-side environment that runs on a scripting language.</p>
        <p>A lot of side technologies are used when designing we apps. Typically, ASP.NET is used, server-side programming makes use of the .NET Architecture and is written in VB.NET and C# languages. Computing in server-side is employed with databases or archives, to communicate with permanent storage. The server will render pages and handle user feedback for the app. Sever-side authentication occurs when the page is requested then posted back to the sever. Moving to other pages and user authentication are examples of server-side processing. The disadvantage of sever-side process is page postback . It adds overhead processing and needs the user to attend for the page to be cached and recreated, limiting efficiency.</p>
        <h3><u>Client-side engineering</u></h3>
        <p>Client-side scripts are embedded onto the client’s web content and processed on the client’s internet browser, unlike server-side code. Client-side scripts are written in an exceedingly kind of scripting language and communicate directly with the HTML elements of the page. CSS is also used for styling. CSS helps style UI elements, interface development, navigation, and validation types are done with the help of HTML. Client-side code is suitable because its appropriate to switch the page elements without contacting the database. Scripting client-side has many advantages such as quicker response times, fewer overheads on the web and a more immersive program. However, the scripting language take more time to creating because the client’s browser must support the scripting language.</p>
