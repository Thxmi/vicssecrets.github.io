        <h2>WWW vs the Internet</h2>
        <p>
            The W3 is not synonymous with the internet. 
            It is a part of the internet. 
            The internet is properly defined as a GAN, Global Area Network. 
            The network is comprised of other sub-networks which in they themselves are comprised of many computers or computing devices.
             The internet is governed an Internet Protocol which is a set of rules and regulations. 
             The sub networks are of many kinds and the internet hosts them well as it has the essential components such as information and
             services with the edition of interlinked websites. This would enable the sub networks to communicate with each other, the WWW being one of the sub networks.

            The Internet is made up of hardware parts. Computers connected however way, copper cables, fibre optic cable, or wireless connection form the network that is the internet.
             The WWW can be described as the software as a collection of webpages through URLs and hyperlinks. It is a part of the services offered by the internet. 
             In addition, we can differentiate the two by the Protocol suite type, which are laws and regulations that rule the internet. The internet uses the Internet Protocol, 
             it deals with the data as a whole and their transmission in packets.
             The W3 is governed by the HTTP which links files, documents, and other resources of the WWW
